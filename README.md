As i'm a huge fan of THE WEEKND and i always listen to his album 'My Dear Melancholy' whenever i feel depressed and this album is one of the best album i have ever listen , so i thought why not to create my own site playing this album, here is the implementation with the understanding of HTML, CSS and JS. I really learned alot while working on this project and created own version of it.
